## Project Overview
---
The aim of this project is to analyze and clean messy data related to patients' health records. The goal is to help enhance critical thinking, attention to details, and problem-solving skills in data cleaning. 

## Data Source
---
The main source is the GreenData Dirty Healthcare Data csv

## Tool used
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Data Analysis

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
At the beginning of Data Cleaning and Preparation, the following steps were taken.
 1. Data was downloaded and inspected
 2. The Data used was dirty and consisted of errors, missing variables and inconsistencies.
 3. Cleaning and Preparing the Data for further analysis.

## Explanatory Data Analysis 
---
This includes exploring of data to identify cities or demographics with higher healthcare needs based on health conditions and admission dates.

## Data Analysis
```CONCAT

```FIND AND REPLACE

## Data Visualization












## Inference
The city of Atlanta has the highest healthcare needs with 973 (59%) counts of admissions of the total entries, followed by Albuquerque with 378 counts (29%) and Baltimore with 305 counts (18%).

## Limitations
1. There was no entry of health conditions, therefore the variable could not be used to identify cities or demographics with higher healthcare needs.
2. Due to a large number of missing entries, errors and inconsistencies, there is restriction in insightful and important analysis that could be carried out.

## Recommendations
1. There should be a revisit of the Data entries to find the missing variables especially in Gender.
2. A lot of inconsistencies should be looked into and corrected, for example, a year old who is already an undergraduate and many others.
